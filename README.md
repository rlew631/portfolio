# React-portfolio

## Commands:

* `npm start` to run locally
* `npm run deploy` to deploy to the gh pages branch and update https://rlew631.github.io/portfolio/

## Task List:

- [ ] figure out how to speed up load time (especially first load)
    - look into [deadfile](https://m-izadmehr.github.io/deadfile/#/)
    - also look into `service worker` at the end of `index.js` 
- [ ] trim down unnecessary css
- [ ] make icons on simpleicons for ros and gazebo
- [ ] add projects:
    - ERP/QMS System
    - Covid Project
- [ ] make a set of colored buttons which let you toggle between "all", "electromechanical engineering", and "Data science" categories
- [ ] in the toolkit add a section for engineering and a section for project management
- [ ] in project info/portfolio change "projecttools" to "pythontools" and create a category for more generic/soft skills
- [ ] fix the x button on the popup window so it's not highlighted
- [ ] see if the entire box can be made to zoom when hovering over, not just the picture
- maybe add a picture or keep the picture in the popup. Something where it's just the box that zooms/rearranged instead of a seperate window would be slick
- [ ] put in a grabcad link like the github one for the drone and FSAE cars. Make the chrome icon for now if not available but make a grabcad icon for sure
- [ ] add soft skills where relevant. Maybe budget planning, conflict mediation, 
- [ ] add youtube link for one of the drone videos
- [ ] add link to paper for FSAE car
- [ ] fixed the icon on the page tab

maybe create a website for the zooplankton project which operates in real time?
put the logic diagrams from the github projects on the pages for project descriptions. Maybe also just completely copy the github descriptions to flesh them out a bit
