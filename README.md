# React-portfolio

## Commands:

* `npm start` to run locally
* `npm run deploy` to deploy to the gh pages branch and update https://rlew631.github.io/portfolio/

## Task List:

- [ ] figure out how to speed up load time (especially first load)
    - look into [deadfile](https://m-izadmehr.github.io/deadfile/#/)
    - also look into `service worker` at the end of `index.js` 
- [ ] trim down unnecessary css
- [ ] make icons on simpleicons for ros and gazebo
- [ ] add projects: ERP/QMS System
- [ ] make a set of colored buttons which let you toggle between "all", "electromechanical engineering", and "Data science" categories
- [ ] in the toolkit add a section for engineering and a section for project management
- [ ] in project info/portfolio change "projecttools" to "pythontools" and create a category for more generic/soft skills
- [ ] fix the x button on the popup window so it's not highlighted
- [ ] see if the entire box can be made to zoom when hovering over, not just the picture
- maybe add a picture or keep the picture in the popup. Something where it's just the box that zooms/rearranged instead of a seperate window would be slick
- [ ] put in a grabcad link like the github one for the drone and FSAE cars. Make the chrome icon for now if not available but make a grabcad icon for sure
- [ ] make the formatting for the "python libraries", "other tools", "tools used" sections more coherent and possibly laid out in a way where soft skills aren't grouped in with "tools"
- [ ] add links for other youtube videos if any are left
