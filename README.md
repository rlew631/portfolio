# React-portfolio

## Commands:

* `npm start` to run locally
* `npm run deploy` to deploy to the gh pages branch and update https://rlew631.github.io/portfolio/

## Task List:

- [ ] figure out how to speed up load time (especially first load)
    - look into [deadfile](https://m-izadmehr.github.io/deadfile/#/)
    - also look into `service worker` at the end of `index.js` 
- [ ] trim down unnecessary css
- [ ] make icons on simpleicons for ros and gazebo
- [ ] add projects:
    - Covid Project (maybe in a new section for collaborative projects)
- [ ] make a set of colored buttons which let you toggle between "all", "electromechanical engineering", and "Data science" categories
- [ ] in the toolkit add a section for engineering and a section for project management
- [ ] in project info/portfolio code change "projecttools" to "pythontools" and create a category for more generic/soft skills
- [ ] fix the x button on the popup window so it's not highlighted by default
- [ ] see if the entire box can be made to zoom when hovering over, not just the picture. related to modal
- maybe add a picture or keep the picture in the popup. Something where it's just the box that zooms/rearranged instead of a seperate window would be slick
- [ ] put in a grabcad link for the drone and FSAE cars. Make the chrome icon for now if not available but make a grabcad icon for sure. It's not in IonIcons but looks open source and can contribute
- [ ] add soft skills where relevant. Maybe budget planning, conflict mediation, training etc.
- [ ] add youtube link for one of the drone videos
- [ ] put the CNC router project on the site!!!
- [ ] put stuff about control systems in drone project and start being sure to align keywords in the project descriptions more

## Maybe List:

- Update RL logo to site caliper/code logo
- adding a less obtrusive modal for the popups in portfolio
- create a website for the zooplankton project which operates in real time?
- put the logic diagrams from the github projects on the pages for project descriptions. Maybe also just completely copy the github descriptions to flesh them out a bit
